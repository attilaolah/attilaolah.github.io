Today is the first day of the [2010 Neoplanta Sprint][2], [Serbia][3]. Now I'm
not really an expert in [Plone][4], but I have had some experience with
[<del>Zope 3</del>][5] [<ins>BlueBream</ins>][6], and since the sprint is
taking place in my favourite city, I decided to take part.

The event is taking place at *Hotel Putnik*, in the city centre. I'm arriving
today afternoon, about 5pm. Looking forward to meet new people.
