We've been working on a stack of libraries that most of use on a daily basis,
focusing mainly on writing documentation, fixing tests, and converting the
whole stack from `repoze.bfg` to Pyramid.

*And we even had a [button machine][7].*

As a result, we:

 * released `Plumber` 1.0 (an alternative to mixin-based extension of classes)
 * updated `Node`, `Yafowil` (and its widget libraries) and `cone.*` to `Pyramid`
 * improved the documentation of the stack
 * set up a [buildbot][5] to run periodical & on-demand unit-tests and code
   checks
 * worked on `agx`
 * had some productive discussions
 * met new friends & did some key signings
 * spent some quality time at the [Metalab][6]
 * had loads of fun in Vienna!
