title: Factoring 100 million digit numbers
---

Yesterday I figured I'll try to [factor][1] the first few numbers greater than
10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰ (or at least find their smallest divisors). The idea was to see how
hard it is to find the divisors of the first few hundred 100,000,001-digit
numbers.

I took a pretty simple approach: for each prime number p, calculate
10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰%p (the remainder after dividing by p). Then I used the result to
create a partial [sieve][3]. After the first 300,000 primes, I still couldn't
find a divisor for 10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰+37.

## Update

10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰+37 is divisible by 6,870,527 (the 468,407th prime). The next one
without a known divisor is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹⁹⁹⁹⁹+69 (tried to divide by the first
2,348,559 primes, no factors found so far).

Here's the smallest prime divisor for the first few 100,000,001-digit integers
(`I` = 10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰):
