title: Writing your own DOM ready listener
---

Today I asked [a question][1] on StackOverflow on how to attach a function to
the browser's [DOM][2] ready event, in a cross-browser way, but *without*
exporting any globals (keeping everything in an anonymous function's closure)
and without including any external file. As a result, with some help of [a
friendly StackOverflow user][3], I put together a code snippet that:

* takes a single function as argument,
* attaches that function to the DOM ready event in all browsers supported by
  [jQuery][4],
* is [idempotent][5] (will never fire the given function twice),
* does not export any globals,
* compiles down to less than 590 bytes (less than 300 bytes gzipped),
* is based on the [jQuery][4] source code (I take no credit for it).
