title: 2011 Buschenschanksprint
---

My lovely <del>girlfriend</del> <ins>now wife</ins> and I have attended the
first four days of [Buschenschanksprint 2011][18], in the beautiful hills and
vineyards of [Berghausen][1], in [Styria][2], [Austria][3].

We had some great time, visited some [Buschenschänke][4], and, of course,
wrote a lot of code. I mostly worked on code that was related to the project
I'm working on. Nevertheless, during the sprint we've implemented a new
library, a [YAML][5] connector for the [YAFOWIL][6] form/widget library, called
[yafowil.yaml][7]. I also contributed a patch to [rod.recipe.appengine][8],
which is already publisted on PyPI.

We've also fixed a few small bugs in [cone.app][9] and [cone.tile][10],
[AnneGilles][11] and [rnix][12] improved the documentation/tutorial, [Gogo][13]
worked on the [axg][14] stack, and [AnneGilles][11] showed us a tutorial on
their new [S3][15]-compliant database.
