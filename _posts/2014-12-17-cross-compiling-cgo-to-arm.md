title: Cross-compiling CGO to ARM
---

This is a story about a a piece of Go code that wanted to be cross-compiled for
the Raspberri Pi. From a private repo. On Wercker. With C/CGO files. And link
it against `libbluetooth`.


## Requirements

* Cross-compile to ARM. Target the [Raspberry Pi].
* Include C source files. Needs `cgo`.
* Link against `libbluetooth`. Needs custom `ldflags`.
* Do all this on [Wercker].

[Raspberry Pi]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/
[Wercker]: https://wercker.com/


## Steps I go through

* Read [Dave Cheney][davecheney]'s [blog post][1] on cross compilation.
* Follow the link to Dave's [new blog post][2] about the same topic.
* Try [`goxc`][3]. It is supposed to be the "easy" route.
* [Issue #54][4] is merged, `goxc` now supports Go 1.4. Sweet!
* It requires building the Go toolchain for every target.
* Doesn't work with the system Go on Gentoo — missing `.hg`, bad file permissions, etc.
* Try fixing all these issues. Fail, then look for a better solution.
* Find out about [Péter Szilágyi][peter_szilagyi]'s [xgo][5]. Seems to fit the bill.
* No need to build the toolchain. It's all [up in the Docker registry][8].
* Find out about [Issue #1][6] (can't build non-public repos).
* Péter isn't interested in solving the issue. He uses [Mitchell Hashimoto][mitchellh]'s [`gox`][7] now.
* Find out about `gox`. Seems to fit the bill even better.
* Fail to build the toolchain locally, for the same reason as `gox`.
* Look for a Wercker box that uses `gox`.
* Find out about [Taichi Nakashima][deeeet]'s [`wercker-box-gox`][9] and [`wercker-step-gox`][10].
* Send a few pull requests. Taichi accepts them shortly. The Wercker box now runs Go 1.4!
* Tell Wercker to use [`tcnksm/gox`][11].
* Set up a build step to use [`tcnxsm/gox`][12].
* Oops! Go 1.4 [won't build C source files by default][13] any more.
* Add a simple build step to `export CGO_ENABLED="1"`.
* Hooray! Now it starts to build at least!
* However, `bluetooth.h` was not found. OK, this one was expected.
* Create a new Wercker box, [gox-bluetooth][14], that `apt-get install`s `libbluetooth-dev`.
* Change my app to use `box: attilaolah/gox-bluetooth`. I'me one more step closer to my goal.
* `cc1: error: unrecognized command line option '-marm'` — well, that doesn't say too much…
* Google brings me to [Go Issue #1880][16]. It is already fixed.
* Scrolling down, I notice [this comment][17].

And [the answer][18]:

Damn. No CGO when cross compiling to ARM. This can't be right. This is all
because GCC doesn't speak ARM. We can fix that. We have Gentoo. We have
[`crossdev`][19]. We can compile a toolchain for ARM. Let's roll.

## Installing the ARM toolchain under Gentoo

This is relatively simple, but rather time consuming. I Install `crossdev` (in
fact, I already have it installed, since I had already built the AVR toolchain
for Arduino). Then I set up the toolchain. This will emerge `binutils`, `gcc`
and friends. 

```
sudo emerge crossdev
sudo crossdev -S -v -t armv6j-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi
```

It takes a few hours on my sistem, so I go grab a(nother) coffee.


## A note on i386

At some point, I tried to cross-compile for i386 as well, but since it wasn't
that important, I stopped after I hit the first few failures.

* The `tcnxsm/gox` build step allows me to specify multiple build targets, let's try i386.
* Apparently CGO for i386 needs `bits/predefs.h`. I need [`libc6-dev:i386`][15]. Welcome to Ubuntu multilib.
* At this point I just try `apt-get install -y build-essential:{i386,amd64}` and hope for the best.
* Bam! `build-essential:i386` conflicts with `build-essential:amd64`. Apparently multilib isn't fully supported in 12.04.
* Let's try to `apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev:i386`?
* Nope! Installing `libc6-dev:i386` removes `build-essential:amd64`, `g++:amd64` and `gcc:amd64` due to the conflicts.
* Screw that. I don't need i386. Let's just stick with ARM. One less problem.


[15]: https://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/libs/libc6-dev

Apparently, compiling `cgo` code to multiple targets on the same host requires
a true multilib system. One that has a multilib GCC. My Gentoo installation is
true multilib, but Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't seem to be. Without proper multilib
support, I need a separate container for each architecture — not so fun.
